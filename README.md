# Made By Miguel — Portfolio Website

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website — a digital playground where design, animation, and frontend engineering collide. This project was built to embody the blend of creativity and technical finesse I bring to every project.

## 🚀 Overview
This portfolio is a **Next.js** single-page experience powered by:
- **Matrix-style digital rain** (custom WebGL/canvas-based component)
- **Framer Motion** animations
- **ReactBits components** (DecryptedText, TextType, etc.)
- **Custom cursor**, **glitch effects**, and a cohesive neon-cyber aesthetic

The goal: create a space that feels alive — reactive, fluid, atmospheric — while staying performant and accessible.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion**
- **ReactBits**
- **Formspree** (Contact form handler)

## 🦾 Final Notes
This project is the result of countless experiments, late-night rebuilds, aesthetic obsessions, and an unreasonable love for The Matrix.
